# **Title**
**FutureCart**: *AI-Driven Demand Prediction for Smarter Retail.*

# **Project Statement:**
*In the realm of E-commerce, demand forecasting plays a pivotal role in ensuring business success. This project aims to develop a demand forecasting model in an E-commerce business that predicts future product demand leveraging time series analysis and multivariate regression based on historical sales data, along with Google Analytics KPIs such as Google clicks and Facebook impressions, which are valuable indicators of customer interest.*

# **Outcomes**

**>Improved Inventory Management:** More accurate demand forecasts lead to better inventory decisions, potentially reducing stock-outs and excess inventory.

**>Enhanced Marketing Efficiency:** Identify periods of high demand for targeted marketing campaigns, optimizing resource allocation.

**>Data-Driven Decision Making:** Reliable forecasts provide a basis for business decisions, such as pricing adjustments or product promotions.

**>Accurate Demand Predictions:** Implement a forecasting model that achieves high accuracy in predicting future demands, thereby improving customer service levels.

**>Scalable Solution:** Develop a solution that can scale to handle large datasets and varying demand patterns across multiple products.

# **Milestone 1: Week 1**
# Module 1: Data Collection
• Understanding the problem statement 

• Gathering sales data from relevant sources (database, store records) 

• Collecting Google Analytics and Facebook Impressions data


# **Milestone 1: Week 2**
# Module 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Preprocessing

• Ensuring my sales data is in a time series format (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly) with timestamps.

• Cleaning and formating data, handling missing values and outliers. Address them using appropriate techniques (imputation, elimination).

• Ploting the distribution plots on independent variables.

• Visualizations to understand trends, seasonality, and correlations.

• Statistical summaries.

# **Milestone 2: Week 3**
# Module 3: Time Series Modeling

• This week, I'm delving into time series modeling, focusing on univariate models.

• I'm exploring various approaches to determine the most suitable model for my specific data.

• I'm being guided through the process of identifying the optimal model parameters.

• I'm experimenting with different parameter combinations.

• I'm selecting the one that yields the lowest error metric.


# **Milestone 2: Week 4**
# Module 4 : Model Evaluation

• I am visualizing the model fit by plotting predicted values against actual sales data.

• I am evaluating the model's performance using metrics like MAE, RMSE, and MAPE.

• I am checking residual plots to ensure no systematic errors remain.

# **Milestone 3: Week 5**
# Module 5: Multivariate Regression (Dynamic) 
## **Sub-Module 5.1: Understanding Dynamic Regression & Data Preparation**  
• I am creating lagged variables for imputed_Quantity, Google clicks, and Facebook impressions by shifting them by one or more time periods.  
 I am also considering interactions between predictors where appropriate, such as analyzing whether clicks during high-season periods have a greater impact.  

# **Milestone 3: Week 6**
# Module 6: Multivariate Regression (Dynamic)  
## **Sub-Module 6.1: Model Construction**  

• I am investigating functions to build dynamic regression models.  
• I am starting with simple models and progressively adding complexity or interactions while working with training data.  

## **Sub-Module 6.2: Model Evaluation**  

• I am using metrics like Adjusted R-squared, RMSE, and MAE to assess how well the model fits the data.  
• I am visualizing residuals and comparing the performance of dynamic regression models to a basic multiple regression model.  

# **Milestone 4: Week 7**
# Module 7: Model Evaluation & Selection & Forecasting

• I am conducting a comparative analysis of model performance on test data, calculating metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).
• I am selecting the best-performing models based on the calculated metrics.
• I am generating forecasts for the future period using the selected models.


### Project Summary:  
This project, **FutureCart: AI-Driven Demand Prediction for Smarter Retail**, focuses on leveraging advanced analytics to forecast product demand in the E-commerce sector. By integrating historical sales data with Google Analytics KPIs (e.g., clicks and impressions), the project employs time series analysis and multivariate regression to build an accurate and robust demand forecasting model.

The primary outcomes include enhanced inventory management, improved marketing strategies, and data-driven decision-making. By utilizing libraries such as **pandas**, **numpy**, **statsmodels**, and **sklearn**, the project ensures efficient data processing, visualization, and predictive modeling. This initiative underscores the transformative power of AI and machine learning in optimizing retail operations.
