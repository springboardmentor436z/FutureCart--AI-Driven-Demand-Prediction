- **Enhance Marketing Efficiency**: By identifying periods of high demand, businesses can plan targeted marketing campaigns and optimize resource allocation.
- **Make Data-Driven Decisions**: With reliable demand forecasts, businesses can adjust pricing, plan promotions, and make other strategic decisions.
- **Ensure Accurate Demand Predictions**: The model aims to achieve high accuracy in predicting future demand, thus improving customer service levels.
- **Develop a Scalable Solution**: The project is designed to handle large datasets and varying demand patterns across multiple products, making it scalable for future use.

By incorporating time series modeling and regression techniques, this project provides a comprehensive solution to forecasting future demand in e-commerce.
