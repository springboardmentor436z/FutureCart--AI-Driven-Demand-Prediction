# About Project

## Title:
### FutureCart: AI-Driven Demand Prediction for Smarter Retail

#### Project Purpose :
This project is part of my allocated project for the **Infosys Springboard Internship 5.0 (Batch 2)**, a two-month (8-week) program. I am enthusiastic about using this opportunity to build valuable skills and contribute meaningfully through this project.

#### Project Statement:
In the realm of E-Commerce, demand forecasting plays a pivotal role in ensuring business success. This project aims to develop a demand forecasting model in an E-commerce business that predicts future product demand leveraging time series analysis and multivariate regression based on historical sales data, along with Google Analytics KPIs such as Google clicks and Facebook impressions, which are valuable indicators of customer interest.

#### Outcomes:
- **Improved Inventory Management**: More accurate demand forecasts lead to better inventory decisions, potentially reducing stock-outs and excess inventory.  
- **Enhanced Marketing Efficiency**: Identify periods of high demand for targeted marketing campaigns, optimizing resource allocation.  
- **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Reliable forecasts provide a basis for business decisions, such as pricing adjustments or product promotions.  
- **Accurate Demand Predictions**: Implement a forecasting model that achieves high accuracy in predicting future demands, thereby improving customer service levels.  
- **Scalable Solution**: Develop a solution that can scale to handle large datasets and varying demand patterns across multiple products.
