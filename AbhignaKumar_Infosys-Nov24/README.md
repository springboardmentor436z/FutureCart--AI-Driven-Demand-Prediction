FutureCart: AI-Driven Demand Prediction for Smarter Retail

## Project Overview:
FutureCart is a machine learning project focused on demand forecasting for e-commerce businesses. Leveraging time series analysis and dynamic multivariate regression, this model predicts product demand using historical sales data and online engagement indicators, such as Google clicks and Facebook impressions. This approach enhances inventory management, marketing efficiency, and data-driven decision-making in retail.

## Key Outcomes:
- Optimized Inventory Management: Accurate demand predictions reduce stock-outs and minimize excess inventory.
- Improved Marketing Strategies: Identifies demand spikes to optimize marketing campaigns.
- Enhanced Business Decisions: Supports pricing and promotional adjustments based on reliable forecasts.
- Scalable Solution: Capable of handling large datasets and varying demand patterns across multiple products.

## Implementation Modules:
1. Data Collection: Gather sales data and online engagement metrics.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Preprocessing: Clean, format, and analyze data for trends and patterns.
3. Time Series Modeling: Develop and optimize time series forecasting models.
4. Dynamic Multivariate Regression: Incorporate lagged predictors for improved demand accuracy.
5. Model Evaluation & Forecasting: Compare models and generate accurate demand forecasts.
6. Documentation and Presentation: Summarize findings, visualizations, and insights.
7. Project Milestones: The project is structured over an 8-week period, with milestones for data collection, model development, evaluation, and final presentation.
