#Title:
FutureCart: AI-Driven Demand Predic5on for Smarter Retail

Project Statement:
In the realm of E-Commerce, demand forecas5ng plays a pivotal role in ensuring business
success. This project aims to develop a demand forecas5ng model in an E-commerce business
that predicts future product demand leveraging 5me series analysis and mul5variate regression
based on historical sales data, along with Google Analy5cs KPIs such as Google clicks and
Facebook impressions, which are valuable indicators of customer interest.

Key Outcomes:
1.Accurate Demand Forecasting: The primary goal of the project is to develop an accurate demand forecasting model that helps predict future product demand based on historical sales data, Google Analytics KPIs, and Facebook impressions.
2.Improved Business Decision-Making: The model provides actionable insights for inventory management, pricing strategies, and marketing campaign optimization by predicting demand patterns accurately.
3.Enhanced Customer Insights: By leveraging Google clicks and Facebook impressions, the model helps identify correlations between customer interest and actual sales, offering deeper insights into customer behavior.
4.Efficient Resource Allocation: By forecasting demand, businesses can allocate resources (e.g., stock, personnel) more effectively, minimizing stockouts and overstock situations

Modules:

Module 1: Data Collection
Understand the problem statement and collect historical sales data, Google Analytics KPIs (Google clicks), and Facebook impressions to serve as predictors.

Module 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Data Preprocessing
Ensure that the data is in a time series format.
Clean and format the data, addressing missing values, outliers, and performing visualizations to understand trends, seasonality, and correlations.

Module 3: Time Series Modelling
Sub Module 3.1: Model Selection – Explore univariate time series models.
Sub Module 3.2: Model Fitting – Identify the optimal model parameters through experimentation.

Module 4: Time Series Model Evaluation & Diagnostics
Sub Module 4.1: Model Evaluation – Visualize the model’s performance and compare predicted vs. actual sales.
Sub Module 4.2: Model Diagnostics – Evaluate using metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and MAPE, and assess residual plots for systematic errors.

Module 5: Dynamic Multivariate Regression
Sub Module 5.1: Data Preparation – Create lagged variables of sales, clicks, and impressions.
Model dynamic relationships and interactions between predictors over time.

Module 6: Dynamic Regression Model Construction & Evaluation
Sub Module 6.1: Model Construction – Develop models using lagged values and interactions.
Sub Module 6.2: Model Evaluation – Assess the model using metrics like Adjusted R-squared, RMSE, and MAE.

Module 7: Model Selection & Forecasting
Perform a comparative analysis of different models based on test data, select the best-performing model, and generate forecasts for future periods
