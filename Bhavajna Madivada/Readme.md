## **Project Workflow**  

### **Phase 1: Data Collection** 🔍 
- **Sales Data:** Compile historical sales records from relevant sources (e.g., databases, store records).  
- **Engagement Metrics:** Gather Google Analytics data (clicks, impressions) and Facebook interaction data.  

---

### **Phase 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Preprocessing** 📊
- **Time-Series Structuring:** Ensure sales data is formatted with appropriate timestamps (daily, weekly, or monthly).  
- **Data Cleaning:** Address missing values and outliers using methods like imputation or elimination.  
- **Visual Exploration:** Create distribution plots and other visualizations to uncover data trends and patterns.  

---

### **Phase 3: Time-Series Modeling** 📉
- **Model Development:** Start with univariate models to capture trends and seasonality.  
- **Parameter Optimization:** Experiment with combinations to identify the best fit, minimizing errors such as MAE, RMSE, and MAPE.  
- **Evaluation & Diagnostics:** Visualize predicted values against actual sales and analyze residuals to eliminate systematic errors.  

---

### **Phase 4: Dynamic Multivariate Regression** 🔗
- **Lagged Variables:** Introduce lagged features for sales, clicks, and impressions to improve predictive accuracy.  
- **Interaction Effects:** Incorporate interactions between predictors, such as the impact of seasonal clicks on demand.  
- **Model Refinement:** Build progressively complex models to balance performance and interpretability.  

---

### **Phase 5: Forecasting & Performance Analysis** ⚖️ 
- **Comparative Evaluation:** Assess model performance using metrics like Adjusted R-squared, MAE, and RMSE.  
- **Future Demand Forecasts:** Generate reliable predictions for upcoming periods to guide strategic decisions.  

---

### **Phase 6: Presentation & Documentation** 📚  
- **Engaging Presentation:** Showcase findings and demonstrate the model’s capabilities through presentation & visualizations.
- **🎬 Demo Video:** Showcase the project’s capabilities and results in action.
