FutureCart: AI-Driven Demand Prediction for Smarter Retail

**Project Overview:** FutureCart is a machine learning project focused on demand forecasting for e-commerce businesses. Leveraging time series analysis and dynamic multivariate regression, this model predicts product demand using historical sales data and online engagement indicators, such as Google clicks and Facebook impressions. This approach enhances inventory management, marketing efficiency, and data-driven decision-making in retail.

**Key Outcomes:**

- *Optimized Inventory Management:* Accurate demand predictions reduce stock-outs and minimize excess inventory.
- *Improved Marketing Strategies:* Identifies demand spikes to optimize marketing campaigns.
- *Enhanced Business Decisions:* Supports pricing and promotional adjustments based on reliable forecasts.
- *Scalable Solution:* Capable of handling large datasets and varying demand patterns across multiple products.

## Milestone 1: Week 1 
Module 1: Data Collection 
- Understand the problem statement
- Gather sales data from relevant sources (database, store records)
- Collect Google Analytics and Facebook Impressions data

## Milestone 1: Week 2 
Module 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Preprocessing 
- Ensure your sales data is in a time series format (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly) with timestamps.
- Clean and format data, handling missing values and outliers. Address them using appropriate techniques (imputa5on, elimina5on).
- Plot the distribution plots on independent variables

## Milestone 2: Week 3
Module 3: Time Series Modelling
- Model Selection
  - Within time series modelling, weâ€™ll be exploring univariate models.
- Model Fitting
  - To identify the optimal model parameters. This involves trying different parameter combinations and selecting the one with the lowest error metric
 
## Milestone 2: Week 4
Module 4: Time Series Modelling
- Model Evaluation
  - Visualize the model fit by plotting predicted values against actual sales data.
- Model Diagnostics
  - Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), or Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).
- Check for residual plots to ensure no systematic errors remain.

## Milestone 3: Week 5
Module 5: Multivariate Regression (Dynamic)
- Understanding Dynamic Regression & Data Preparation
  - Dynamic Regression is a type of regression that incorporates lagged values of the dependent variables. The idea is that past sales, past clicks, etc., can influence future sales.
- Create lagged variables of sales, Google clicks, and Facebook impressions by shibing them by one or more time periods.
- Consider interactions between predictors if appropriate (e.g., do clicks in high season periods have greater impact).

## Milestone 3: Week 6
Module 6: Multivariate Regression (Dynamic)
- Model Construction
  - Investigate functions to build dynamic regression models.
  - Start with simple models and progressively add complexity or interactions on training data.
- Model Evaluation
  - Use metrics like Adjusted R-squared, RMSE, MAE to assess model fit.
  - Visualize residuals and compare dynamic regression performance to a basic multiple regression model.
 
## Milestone 4: Week 7
Module 7: Model Evaluation & Selection & Forecasting
- Comparative analysis of model performance (metrics calculated like MAE, RMSE, MAPE) on test data.
- Select the best performing models.
- Generate forecasts for future period.

## Milestone 4: Week 8
Module 8: Project Presentation and Documentation
- Prepare a presentation representing the whole work
- Demo video showing all the work
