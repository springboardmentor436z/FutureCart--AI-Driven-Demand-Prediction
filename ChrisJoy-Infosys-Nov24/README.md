 FutureCart: AI-Driven Demand Prediction for Smarter Retail

Project Overview:
FutureCart is a machine learning project focused on demand forecasting for e-commerce businesses.By applying time series 
analysis and dynamic multivariate regression, the model predicts future demand by using historical sales data and key online 
engagement indicators such as Google clicks and Facebook impressions. This approach helps optimize inventory management, 
marketing strategies, and data-driven business decisions in the retail sector.

Key Outcomes:
Better Inventory Management:
Accurate demand forecasts result in better decisions on inventory, thus minimizing stockouts and excess inventories.

Better Marketing Efficiency
Know when to market during peak demands, thus optimizing resource usage.
Data-Driven Decisions
Reliable forecasts support business decisions such as price adjustments, product promotions, and restocking of inventories.
Highly Accurate Demand Predictions
Achieve high accuracy in predicting future demand. This improves customer service levels and aligns inventory with actual needs.
Scalable Solution
Design a solution that can scale up to large datasets and different patterns of demand across various products.

Implementation Phases:
1. Data Collection:
Understanding the Problem Statement:
Grasp the core challenges in demand forecasting and how customer engagement data plays a role.

Sales Data Collection:
Collect historical sales data, formatted in a time series structure, for example, daily, weekly, monthly.

Engagement Metrics:
Collect Google Analytics KPIs such as clicks and Facebook impressions to measure customer interest and enhance model accuracy.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Preprocessing
Data Formatting
Ensure sales data is formatted as time series with timestamps and frequency intervals.

Data Cleaning
Handle missing values and outliers through imputation or elimination strategies

Visualizations
Draw plots to see how data distributions are, trends, seasonalities, and correlations in data

Statistical Summaries
Summary of major statistics to gain insight into what data does.

3. Time Series Modeling:
Univariate Models:
First, model demand using univariate time series techniques such as AR,MA,ARIMA,SARIMA,ARIMAX,SARIMAX to capture trend and seasonality.

Model Parameterization:
Try different parameter combinations and choose the best fit model based on MAE, RMSE, and MAPE.

Model Evaluation:
Plot the performance of the model by comparing the predicted values with actual sales data and residuals.

4. Dynamic Multivariate Regression
Understanding Dynamic Regression & Data Preparation:
Lagged Variables:
Construct lagged predictors for past sales data, Google clicks, and Facebook impressions to capture time-dependent relationships.

Interaction Effects
Interaction Effects: Investigate interactions among the predictors, such as the effect of engagement metrics on peak seasons.

Model Development
Regression Models
Construct dynamic regression models with incremental complexity by adding interaction terms and tuning parameters. Model Evaluation
Performance Metrics
Utilize metrics like Adjusted R-squared, RMSE, and MAE to assess the regression model fit.

Residual Analysis
Check for patterns in residuals to ensure no systematic errors remain.

5. Model Evaluation & Selection & Forecasting:
Model Comparison:
Compare the performance of time series and dynamic regression models using error metrics (MAE, RMSE, MAPE).

Model Selection:
Choose the model that balances well between accuracy and robustness.

Forecasting:
Create forecasts for future periods that could guide business decisions.

Project Summary:
FutureCart emphasizes applying machine learning techniques to forecast product demand in e-commerce. By integrating historical 
sales data with Google Analytics KPIs, namely clicks and impressions, the project uses time series analysis and dynamic 
multivariate regression to develop an accurate demand prediction model. The solution helps businesses optimize their inventory, 
marketing, and decision-making strategies. Using the Python libraries pandas, numpy, statsmodels, and sklearn, FutureCart demonstrates 
how AI and machine learning can simplify retail operations and lead to more intelligent, data-based decisions.
