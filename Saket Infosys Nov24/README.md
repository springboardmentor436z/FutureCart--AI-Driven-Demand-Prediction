# FutureCart: AI-Driven Demand Prediction for Smarter Retail

## Project Overview
This project, titled **FutureCart**, focuses on creating a comprehensive demand forecasting model tailored for E-commerce businesses. By leveraging historical sales data along with key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Google clicks and Facebook impressions, this project aims to enhance decision-making through accurate time series analysis and multivariate regression models.

## Project Statement
Accurate demand forecasting is crucial in the E-commerce industry to optimize inventory, plan marketing strategies, and improve customer satisfaction. The objective of this project is to build a robust demand prediction system capable of handling large datasets and varying demand patterns across different products.

## Key Outcomes
- **Improved Inventory Management**: Enhanced forecasts lead to better inventory decisions, reducing the risk of stock-outs and excess inventory.
- **Enhanced Marketing Efficiency**: Identify high-demand periods for targeted marketing, optimizing resource allocation.
- **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Provides a reliable foundation for business decisions, such as pricing strategies and promotions.
- **Accurate Demand Predictions**: Implements a forecasting model achieving high prediction accuracy, ultimately boosting customer service levels.
- **Scalable Solution**: Develops a system that can be adapted to handle complex, large-scale data.

## Project Modules
1. **Data Collection**: Gathering historical sales data and KPIs.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and formatting the data, visualizing trends, handling missing values, and preparing the data for modeling.
3. **Time Series Modeling**: Developing models to capture trends, seasonality, and other time-based patterns.
4. **Multivariate Regression (Dynamic)**: Building a multivariate regression model incorporating multiple KPIs for more accurate demand predictions.
5. **Model Evaluation & Selection**: Comparing model performance and selecting the best-fit forecasting method.
6. **Project Presentation & Documentation**: Summarizing findings and providing thorough documentation for replication and understanding.

## Data Sources and Formats
- **Sales Data**: Contains timestamps and sales quantities.
- **Google Clicks Data**: KPI indicating user interaction through online ads.
- **Facebook Impressions Data**: KPI showing the number of times an ad is displayed.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Preprocessing
### Objectives:
- Convert sales data to a time series format.
- Clean and handle missing values using imputation methods.
- Detect and manage outliers with IQR-based techniques.
- Plot data distributions and visualize trends, seasonality, and correlations.

## Explanation:
- **Distributions**: Visualizes the spread and skewness of key variables.
- **Time Series Analysis**: Highlights trends, seasonal effects, and cyclic patterns.
- **Correlation Matrix**: Shows relationships between variables to identify potential predictors for demand.
- **Statistical Summaries**: Provides metrics like mean, median, and standard deviation to understand the data spread.

## Conclusion
This repository provides a comprehensive guide to understanding and analyzing E-commerce sales data, preparing it for predictive modeling, and gaining actionable business insights. The next steps involve building and evaluating time series models and multivariate regressions for better demand forecasting.
